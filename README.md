# odin-recipes
My journey with the Odin Project begins! In this specific project, I take on some famous recipes and put them together on an HTML file.
Since there is no CSS involved, I am focusing on a brutalist style for now. Everything was done using VSCode, and thank you Odin Project for your guidance and motivation!
